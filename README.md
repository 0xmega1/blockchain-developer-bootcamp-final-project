# SuperMeta
## The Opportunity

NFTs introduce a new opportunity for asset owners to transport their NFTs across the metaverse in order to extract new utility from their digital items. This could look as as simple as using an NFT in a new experience - e.g., transporting a digitally owned piece of clothing from one virtual reality experience to another. This could also be a matter of combining the meta data from two or more NFTs into a new item - e.g., combing a sword and shield into a more powerful weapon. 

While we can't predict all of the use cases ahead of time, as NFT enthusiasts continue exploring new use cases, there will be a growing need to interpret NFT meta data in meaningful ways. 

## The Problem
Currently, there are no standards for structuring NFT meta data and it is up to developers to interpret or ignore this information. If NFTs are going to progress as composable assets there needs to be a way for owners and developers to create and interpret NFT meta data. 

## The Solution
SuperMeta is a dapp that helps developers and owners to view and work with NFT meta data. 

## User Stories 

As a user, I want to mint a new NFT that represents the combined meta data from one or more of my NFTs.

## Reserach Questions
1. How is NFT meta data retrieved? 
2. How can meta data indexed for an entire contract?
3. What are the implications of minting a new NFT that represents the meta data from multiple underlying assets?
4. How would this be perceived by a consuming dapp?
5. What would happen if the owner sold an underlying asset? 
6. Would the contract need to custody the underlying asset in order for the new NFT to be a useable source of meta data?
